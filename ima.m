# Making the binarized matrix.

#   Loop to fill the OUT matrix with the positions and binarized image: 
#  It places "valout" on the output matrix. So this matrix has only two values: 0
# and "valout". Then it is easy to look for the external edges.
#  It is done on a double loop because with vector logics and so on,
# the program gives not right results.

    if ( std(row) > std_dev_par ) #When there is data on the row, no just noise ->
    % Signaled by a standard deviation higher than "std_dev_par".
      halfrow = max(row)/2; # Take half of the maximum value for this row and use it as mark for margins
	for j = 1 : columns(T)
           %  In every column of the OUT row change the value to "valout" if 
           % the column value is higher than halfrow.

   pos = find(Out(i,:)==valout); # Find the positions of "valout" in the output matrix and
   % store them in an index vector(POS)
   if (columns(pos) > 1) #When there are really values
     j = j+1;

# Data treatment

#Remove the zeros on the matrix results:

#(Made using logical indexing)

#Calibration of pixels in time and space and centering:
#CAREFUL: THIS CALIBRATION IS VALID FROM ALEX086 TO ALEX099 ONLY !!!!!

move(:,5) = (move(:,2)-zenter) .* 0313; #Passing pixels to micrometers and centering.
move(:,6) = (move(:,3)-zenter) .* 0313; #Passing pixels to micrometers and centering.

#smoothing radius data with the function "supsmu", check function help to see how it works:
move(:,5) = supsmu(move(:,4),move(:,5),"span",0.01);
move(:,6) = supsmu(move(:,4),move(:,6),"span",0.01);

# Data transforming
